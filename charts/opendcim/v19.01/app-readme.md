# openDCIM

openDCIM is a 100% donation and community supported open source Data Center Inventory Management application.
There are installations around the world ranging from small sites to large, multi-national corporations tracking tens of
thousands of assets in dozens of data centers.

To use the openDCIM helm chart, you must establish two things
* A database backend compatible with MySQL.
* An external authentication and/or authorization system, such as LDAP or Active Directory (SAML, hopefully, in the next release)

Please see the openDCIM website at https://opendcim.org for more information.
